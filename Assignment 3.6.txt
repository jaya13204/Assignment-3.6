1.If 7TB is the available disk space per node (9 disks with 1 TB, 2 disk for operating system etc.
were excluded.). Assuming initial data size is 600 TB. How will you estimate the number of data
nodes (n)?


The formula needed to calculate the number of data nodes is:
 
n= H/d = c*r*S/(1-i)*d 

H=c*r*S   and d=(1-i)*d

where

-H=Hadoop storage 

-c = average compression ratio
   Compression ratio refers to type of compression used.If not  take c=1;

-r=Replication factor
     Replication factor is usually 3 in production cluster.

-S=size of the data which is needed to be moved to hadoop
         It can be a combination of historical data and incremental data.
         The incremental data can be projected over a period of time (Take for example 3years) 

-i=Intermediate factor
     Intermediate factor is usually  1/3 or 1/4

-d= disk space availability per node


The solution is:
  H=600TB   d=7TB

n=H/d
  =600/7
  =85.7
 
therfore, 86 data nodes are needed.

2.Imagine that you are uploading a file of 500MB into HDFS.100MB of data is successfully
uploaded into HDFS and another client wants to read the uploaded data while the upload is still in
progress. What will happen in such a scenario, will the 100 MB of data that is uploaded will it be
displayed?



*The  block size here is 100 MB.The default block size of Hadoop version 1.x is 64 MB and Hadoop version 2.x is 128 MB.

*We will have 5 blocks replicated thrice and that five blocks is for  file , client , name node and data node . 

*The client wil take the first block and will approach the  name node asking  for data node's location to store this block . 

* When the client is aware of information of  datanode ,it will reach data node and will start copying the first block . 

*Then the client will get confirmation on first block and it will continue  the same procedure for the second block also. 

*Therefore,the reader can read that 100 MB uploaded data while  remaining was uploading .
